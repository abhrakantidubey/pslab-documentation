# EXPERIMENT TO CHECK THAT Ps-lab COMPASS DEFLECTS WHEN IT COMES IN CONTACT WITH MAGNET.
+ 1.REQUIREMENTS:
Android phone with a) compass sensor and b) PSLab app installed,magnet and a compass.
 1.STEPS:
 STEP 1:
Take the magnet near to the compass.You will see that compass has deflecting.
STEP 2:
Take the magnet near to the Ps-lab Compass.You will see that, there is no delection in it.
+ 3.RESULT:
Thus through this experiment it shows that Magnets do interact with the magnet inside a normal but that show no effect on the PSLab compass.
+ 4.CONCLUSION:
By this Experiment we can understand that the PSLab compass uses GPS and other sensors to provide us directions and Do not uses any magnet to find directions. It further examine the GPS and Sensor readings and then using this data calibrate the compass needles according to our phones calibration and general position.
YOU CAN CHECK THE SCREENSHOTS.
